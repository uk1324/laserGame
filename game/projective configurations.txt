Configurations are arrangements of points and lines such that there are p points and l lines and each point is incident with lambda lines and each line is incident with pi points.
I thought that it may be interesting to add some levels that involve them, but most of them are too complex.

The least complicated one that isn't trival is probably the complete quadrilateral.

Using a related construction the harmonic conjugate of a point can be found.
